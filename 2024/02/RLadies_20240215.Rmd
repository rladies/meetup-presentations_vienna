## \textbf{\huge Keynotes at useR! }

```{r, echo = F}
key <- c(8,7,7,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,7)
keyf <- c(0,1,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,4)
df <- data.frame(Year = 2008:2018, Female = keyf, Male = key-keyf)
library(reshape2)
DF1 <- melt(df, id.var="Year")
DF1$variable <- ordered(DF1$variable, levels=c("Male", "Female")) 
library(ggplot2)
bp <- ggplot(DF1, aes(x = Year, y = value, fill = variable)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
bp + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#999999", "#88398A"))
```

<!--## Statistics for women in STEM

<!-- * In a survey among useR!2016 participants, two groups of respondents have been highlighted: -->

<!--     - People who do not feel they are part of the R community, but who would like to participate in workshops, or an R user group meeting close to them.   -->

<!--     <!-- They are more likely women, people with master or undergraduate degree. --> 
<!--     - People who feel they are part of the R community, but do not have time to participate to meetings.  -->

<!--    <!--They are more likely men, people with caring responsibilities, or people with a doctorate. --> 

<!-- @RWomenTaskforce -->
